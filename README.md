# Learn Rust
This repository will serve as my place to learn the basics of Rust. I will follow guides and other learning materials, but I will try to take the extra steps to improve on the resources I use so that I can learn.

## Guides I Have/Will Follow

- [The Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Contributing
I don't know why you would contribute code (and I ask that you don't, this is for me to learn), but if you want to contribute, you can add guides you think I should use and/or project ideas below:
